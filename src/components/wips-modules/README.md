# WIPs-modules
*Note*
- This folder holds the simple version of modules, which are WIPs (work-in-progress), e.g. fully functional labeling tools only for fixed data-type or label-task.
- They are temporarily stored as implemented instances, which will be called by `App.vue` in the `playground` to show the results of the corresponding data-type and label-task implementations.
